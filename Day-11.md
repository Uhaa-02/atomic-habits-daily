# Day 11 – Atomic Habits 📘

In this chapter, James Clear explains **Premack’s Principle**, which states that a behavior you want to do can be used to motivate a behavior you need to do. By pairing difficult habits with enjoyable ones, habits become more attractive and easier to follow.

## Key Ideas

## Personal Reflection
This chapter helped me understand that motivation doesn’t have to come from willpower. By pairing tasks I avoid with activities I enjoy, I can make difficult habits easier and more enjoyable.

## Action Step
I will apply Premack’s Principle today by pairing a challenging habit with something I enjoy, such as listening to music while studying.
