# Day 05 – Atomic Habits 

##  Chapter Summary
This chapter explains how habits are often driven by **unconscious cues**. Through the story **The Man Who Didn’t Look Right**, James Clear shows how our brain constantly scans the environment and notices changes, even when we are not consciously aware of them.

##  Key Ideas
- Our brain is a powerful prediction machine.
- We often notice changes in our environment subconsciously.
- Habits are triggered when something feels “out of place”.
- Awareness is the foundation of behavior change.

##  Key Takeaways
- You don’t need motivation to start a habit — you need the right cues.
- Becoming aware of cues helps in breaking bad habits.
- Small changes in environment can strongly influence behavior.

##  Personal Reflection
This chapter helped me understand that many of my habits happen automatically without conscious thought. By paying attention to what feels “different” or “out of place”, I can better recognize the triggers behind my habits.

##  Action Step
Today, I will observe my surroundings carefully and note any cues that trigger my habits, both good and bad.

## Favorite Line
"Until you make the unconscious concious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate".
