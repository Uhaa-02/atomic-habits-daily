This chapter says "why tiny changes make a big differences. Small habits may seem insignificant, but when repeated daily, they lead to remarkable results over time. Success is not about big breakthroughs; it is about consistency and systems.

## Key Ideas

- Small improvements (1% better every day) add up in the long run.
- Bad habits compound negatively just like good habits compound positively.
- Focus on the process, not just the goal.

## Key Takeaways
- Progress is often slow and invisible at first.
- Consistency matters more than intensity.
- Systems are more important than goals.

##  Personal Reflection
Today’s reading taught me that I should not underestimate small daily actions. Even if progress feels slow, staying consistent will eventually lead to big changes.

## Action Step
I will focus on improving one small habit today instead of trying to change everything at once.
