# Day 04 – Atomic Habits 

## Chapter Summary - How build better habits in 4 Simple Steps
This chapter introduces the *Habit Loop* and explains how habits work through four stages: cue, craving, response, and reward. Understanding this loop helps in building good habits and breaking bad ones.

## Key Ideas
- A habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
- Every habit follows a four-step pattern: *Cue → Craving → Response → Reward*.
- Cues trigger habits and make behaviors automatic.
- Cravings provide motivation for habits.
- Rewards reinforce habits and make them stick.

## Key Takeaways
- To change a habit, you must understand its cue and reward.
- Making cues obvious helps in building good habits.
- Removing cues helps in breaking bad habits.
- Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.

## Personal Reflection
