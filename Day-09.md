# Day 09 – Atomic Habits 📘

## Chapter Summary- The Secret to Self-Control
In **“The Secret to Self-Control”**, James Clear explains that people with strong self-control are not better at resisting temptation—they are better at **avoiding it**. Self-control comes from designing the environment to reduce exposure to bad cues.

## Key Ideas
- Self-control is about environment, not willpower.
- The best way to break bad habits is to avoid triggers.
- Removing cues is more effective than resisting them.
- Behavior is shaped by what we see and experience daily.

## Key Takeaways
- Disciplined people structure their lives to minimize temptation.
- Willpower is limited; environment is constant.
- Make bad habits invisible to reduce their influence.
- Change surroundings before trying to change behavior.
- Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself.
- Rather than making it obvious, make it invisible.

## Personal Reflection
This chapter helped me realize that relying on willpower is not a long-term solution. By removing distractions and bad cues from my environment, I can make good decisions more easily.

## Action Step
I will remove one trigger today that leads to a bad habit, such as hiding my phone while studying.
