# Day 15 – Atomic Habits 📘

## Chapter Summary
In **“The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change”**, James Clear introduces the **Fourth Law of Behavior Change: Make it satisfying**. Habits stick when they feel rewarding, and immediate satisfaction plays a crucial role in whether a habit is repeated.

## Key Ideas
- The fourth law of behavior change is **Make it satisfying**.

- Delayed rewards make habits harder to maintain.

## Key Takeaways

- Immediate satisfaction increases consistency.
- Tracking progress can make habits more satisfying.
- Positive reinforcement strengthens habit formation.

## Personal Reflection
This chapter helped me understand why some habits don’t last even when they are good for me. If I add a small reward or track my progress, staying consistent becomes much easier.

## Action Step
I will add an immediate reward to one good habit today, such as tracking it or celebrating completion.

## Favorite Line
> “What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.”
