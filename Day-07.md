# Day 07 – Atomic Habits 📘

## Chapter Summary
This chapter explains how **habit stacking** helps in building new habits by linking them to existing ones. By using habits you already perform daily as cues, you can create a clear and reliable plan for behavior change.

## Key Ideas
- Habit stacking builds new habits on top of existing ones.
- A clear cue makes habits easier to start.
- Specific plans reduce decision fatigue.
- Consistency increases when habits are tied to routines.

## Key Takeaways
- The habit stacking formula:  
  **After I [current habit], I will [new habit].**
- Linking habits creates structure in daily routines.
- Small habits become powerful when repeated consistently.

## Personal Reflection
This chapter showed me that I don’t need extra time to build new habits. I can attach new habits to routines I already follow, making consistency easier.

## Action Step
I will use habit stacking today by attaching one new habit to an existing daily routine.
