# Day 03 – Atomic Habits 

##  Chapter Summary - How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
This chapter explains that real behavior change is not about setting goals, but about changing identity. Lasting habits are built when actions become part of who you believe you are.

## Key Ideas
- True behavior change starts with identity change. **Example** : The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become.
- Goals focus on outcomes, systems focus on identity and process.
- Habits stick when they align with your self-image.
-Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

## 3 Levels of Behaviour Change
- **Layer 1:** Changing your outcomes.
- **Layer 2:** Changing you process.
- **Layer 3:** Changing your identity.

## Key Takeaways
- Focus on **who you want to become**, not just what you want to achieve.
- Small habits reinforce a new identity over time.
- Identity-based habits are more sustainable than outcome-based habits.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand idendity.

## Personal Reflection
Today’s reading made me realize that habits are not just tasks, but expressions of identity. If I see myself as a disciplined and consistent person, my habits will naturally support that belief.

## Action Step
I will choose one habit today that supports the identity I want to build and practice it consistently.
## Favorite Lines
- Outcomes are about what you get. Proccesses are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
